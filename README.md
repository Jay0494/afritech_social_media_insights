---

## 1. Project Overview

**Client:** AfriTech Electronics
**Industry:** Consumer Electronics
**Project Type:** Social Media Analytics, Crisis Monitoring, Revenue Risk Analysis
**Tools:** SQL, Power BI, Excel, Sentiment Analysis, KPI Modeling

### Business Context

AfriTech is a fast-growing electronics brand operating across multiple digital platforms. Despite strong market presence and high customer engagement, the company experienced **declining revenue, increased product recalls, and rising customer complaints** in 2023.

The leadership team required a **data-driven monitoring system** to understand how **social sentiment, crisis response, and product issues** were impacting revenue, customer trust, and competitive positioning.

---

## 2. Business Problem

Despite its market success, AfriTech faced several interconnected challenges driven by public perception and social sentiment:

1. **Negative Social Buzz**
   Increasing negative conversations across digital platforms damaged brand perception and weakened customer trust.

2. **Rising Customer Complaints**
   Product defects, billing issues, and slow support response times resulted in customer frustration and declining satisfaction.

3. **Product Recalls**
   Media coverage of product recalls amplified negative sentiment and heightened stakeholder concern.

4. **Competitive Pressure**
   Rival brands actively leveraged AfriTech’s reputation challenges to attract dissatisfied customers.

These challenges highlighted the urgent need for a **centralized, data-driven social media monitoring and crisis-response analytics framework**.

---

---

## 6. Key Insights & Interpretation

### 6.1 Reputation Risk Is Being Sustained by Slow Response Times

Despite high engagement, AfriTech’s **6-month average crisis response time** allowed negative sentiment to persist and spread. With **over half of complaints unresolved**, customer frustration remained visible across social platforms, suppressing trust recovery.

**Insight:**
Negative sentiment is not short-lived — it compounds when resolution is delayed.

---

### 6.2 Product Recalls Are Directly Suppressing Revenue

* Overall product recall rate: **49.3%**
* Smartwatches recorded the highest recall rate (**53.3%**) and the **lowest revenue contribution (5.8%)**

Combined with a high AOV, unresolved recall-related complaints represent **high-value revenue leakage** rather than low-value volume loss.

**Insight:**
Revenue decline is driven more by **trust erosion** than demand weakness.

---

### 6.3 Engagement Does Not Equal Conversion

* Customers aged **18–27** showed the highest engagement (8.3%) but lower transaction contribution.
* Customers aged **58–69** recorded the highest transaction volume despite lower engagement.

**Insight:**
Social media drives awareness, but **conversion depends on trust and resolution effectiveness**, not engagement volume.

---

### 6.4 Revenue Is Highly Concentrated and Vulnerable

* **VIP customers:** 47.66% of revenue
* **Returning customers:** 42.29%
* **New customers:** only 10%

Any reputational damage affecting loyal customers poses a **disproportionate revenue risk**.

---

### 6.5 Competitive Threat Is Intensifying

With competitor mentions nearly matching AfriTech’s brand mentions, unresolved complaints and recalls are creating opportunities for rivals to position themselves as safer alternatives.

**Insight:**
AfriTech’s operational gaps are indirectly fueling competitor growth.
